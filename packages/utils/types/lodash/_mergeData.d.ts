/**
 * Merges the function metadata of `source` into `data`.
 *
 * Merging metadata reduces the number of wrappers used to invoke a function.
 * This is possible because methods like `_.bind`, `_.curry`, and `_.partial`
 * may be applied regardless of execution order. Methods like `_.ary` and
 * `_.rearg` modify function arguments, making the order in which they are
 * executed important, preventing the merging of metadata. However, we make
 * an exception for a safe combined case where curried functions have `_.ary`
 * and or `_.rearg` applied.
 *
 * @private
 * @param {Array} data The destination metadata.
 * @param {Array} source The source metadata.
 * @returns {Array} Returns `data`.
