 *
 * The property `world.gravity` has been moved to `engine.gravity`.
 *
 * For back-compatibility purposes this module will remain as a direct alias to `Matter.Composite` in the short term during migration.
 * Eventually this alias module will be marked as deprecated and then later removed in a future release.
